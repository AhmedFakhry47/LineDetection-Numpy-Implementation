# LineDetection-Numpy-Implementation

The project is a simple implementation for edge detection. It's a python.</b>
class and all the methods are implemented in numpy. No opencv methods are used.</b>
It starts by taking an input image, after that converting the image to gray image.
Binarize the image, and finally take hough transform to detect lines.</b>

The repo includes a google colab notebook to further </b>
demonstrate the conducted test.</b>
